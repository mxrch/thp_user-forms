# The Hacking Project - User Forms


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to work on the forms and establish a list of users registered in the database.

The live version is available on Heroku here : https://mxrch-user-form.herokuapp.com/

***This includes :***
* Users,
* Gossips,
* Tags,
* and private messages.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_user-forms
$ bundle install
```

You can also generate random data in the database by doing :
```sh
$ rails db:seed
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
